# LLVMSharp

LLVMSharp is a multi-platform .NET Standard library for accessing the LLVM infrastructure. The bindings are auto-generated using [ClangSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/clangsharp) parsing LLVM-C header files.

![ci](https://github.com/dotnet/clangsharp/workflows/ci/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)

A nuget package for the project is provided here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/llvmsharp.

A convenience package which provides the native libLLVM library for several platforms is provided here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/libLLVM

NOTE: These may be out of date as compared to the latest sources. New versions are published as appropriate and a nightly feed is not currently available.

### Features

 * Auto-generated using LLVM C headers files, and supports all functionality exposed by them (more than enough to build a full compiler)
 * Type safe (LLVMValueRef and LLVMTypeRef are different types, despite being pointers internally)
 * Nearly identical to LLVM C APIs, e.g. LLVMModuleCreateWithName in C, vs. LLVM.ModuleCreateWithName (notice the . in the C# API)

### Building LLVMSharp

On Linux using .NET Core:

```bash
 $ git clone http://github.com/dotnet/llvmsharp
 $ cd LLVMSharp
 $ dotnet build
```

On Windows using .NET Core

**Note:** - you need to run these commands from the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.

```bash
 :> git clone http://github.com/mjsabby/LLVMSharp
 :> cd LLVMSharp
 :> dotnet build
```
